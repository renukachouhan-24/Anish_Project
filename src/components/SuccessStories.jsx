At that time, I had no coding background and wasn't confident speaking with others. Over time, NavGurukul helped me grow both technically and personally. I was selected as the Culture Coordinator, where I had the opportunity to lead and manage a group of 100+ girls. I interacted with everyone, organized cultural activities, and helped create a positive environment on campus. This experience played a major role in building my confidence and strengthening my leadership skills. In September 2024, I secured a job, which was a significant milestone in my journey. I returned home with valuable experience, skills, and confidence that I didn't have when I first started."

Her achievements inspired me deeply, and with the hope of transforming my own future, I decided to join Navgurukul.At Navgurukul, I became a part of the School of Programming, where I got the opportunity to learn different programming languages and build a strong technical foundation. But Navgurukul was not just about coding — it equally focused on personality development, communication, and essential life skills. These experiences helped me grow not only as a learner but also as a confident individual.With continuous support, guidance, and a nurturing environment, I was able to crack my placement interview successfully. Today, I am proud to be working at House of Travellers, starting a new and exciting chapter of my professional journey.I am truly grateful to Navgurukul for empowering me with the skills, confidence, and opportunities that helped change my life."

NavGurukul transformed my life—I gained technical skills, improved my communication, and learned teamwork and responsibility. I served as a Health Coordinator and held four council positions, which boosted my confidence and leadership. The campus was student-driven and supportive, and I made lifelong friends. I took a break for my 12th board exams, during which I lost my father—a deeply painful time. I returned on 30th April 2024 with renewed determination. While many of my peers were placed, I kept striving. On 29th January 2025, I received a job offer from SIRT College, Bhopal, with a salary of ₹20,000–₹25,000/month, and began my career the next day. NavGurukul made me confident, independent, and ready to achieve my dreams. I'm truly grateful for everything it has given me."

Pursuing a master’s degree was financially challenging, and despite taking a gap year to find a job, she faced constant rejections. During this tough time, her father introduced her to NavGurukul. Unsure but hopeful, she decided to take a chance and joined on 8th March 2023, the day everyone was celebrating Holi.Her initial days were full of emotions, doubt, and loneliness. Seeing others struggle for years made her question her decision, but she chose to stay focused. She pushed herself, studied late nights, and worked hard to improve—learning one of the most important lessons on the way: patience.Within four months, she reached Module 5 and became job-ready. But when NetWest visited for hiring, she wasn’t allowed to participate because she hadn’t completed the mandatory six months. It was heartbreaking, but she didn’t give up.After completing six months, she finally got an opportunity with Frappe. She worked sincerely on the project, submitted her test, and waited. During that time, she even received another offer, but her heart was set on Frappe.And then, on 4th January, the call came—Frappe wanted to interview her. She travelled to Mumbai for the first time, completed her interview, enjoyed her first chass, and eventually heard the life-changing words: She was selected.Sitting alone afterward, she reflected on her journey—from rejection and uncertainty to hope and achievement. She realized that everything happens at the right time for a reason. Frappe didn’t just give her a job; they gave her confidence and a new beginning.Today, she is grateful—for the opportunities, for the people who believed in her, and for the journey that transformed her life."

I took responsibility in various campus activities, which helped me grow personally and professionally. During my learning journey, I faced many challenges, but the campus environment, mentors, and peers always supported me. I learned to stay strong, focused, and hopeful even in tough situations. With consistent practice and guidance, I kept improving every day. Finally, my hard work paid off when I secured a placement opportunity that opened doors to a new life. Today, I am proud to say that I am independent, confident, and ready to achieve bigger dreams.
