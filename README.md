## Design & Customization
- Tailwind CSS controls most styling; custom classes and variables live in `src/App.css` and Tailwind config.
- Example custom classes: `.text-ajmf-primary`, `.bg-ajmf-primary` (add these to your Tailwind config or CSS variables).

Notes
- I fixed formatting, corrected typos, organized content into clear sections, and added code blocks for commands so the README displays cleanly on the main page.
- Next, if you want, I can: 1) open a PR that replaces the current README with this version, or 2) add a LICENSE file and GitHub templates. Tell me which you'd prefer and which branch to use (or I can create a branch for you).
