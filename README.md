🌟 Anish Jadhav Memorial Foundation (AJMF) Website Frontend 🌟
Project Overview
This is the official frontend repository for the Anish Jadhav Memorial Foundation (AJMF) Skilling Institute website.

The website's primary goal is to showcase the foundation's mission—empowering underprivileged youth through skills training—and to highlight the facilities, residential programs (in collaboration with NavGurukul), and opportunities for partnership and donation.

The design emphasizes a clean, modern, and trustworthy aesthetic, featuring key sections like an interactive campus tour, a "Day in the Life" routine, and transparent details on infrastructure and sustainability.

🚀 Key Features
Responsive Design: Built using React and Tailwind CSS for optimal viewing on all devices.
Visual Campus Tour: An attractive, interactive photo gallery with hover effects to showcase the campus.
Holistic Experience: Detailed sections covering the daily residential life, including academics, meals, and cultural activities.
Modern UI: Utilizes a professional color palette (Saffron, White, Dark Gray) and dynamic components (3D hover cards, sticky capacity bar).
Technology Stack: Developed using modern JavaScript/React and bundled with Vite.

🎨 Design and Customization
The core UI styling is controlled in src/App.css. If you wish to customize the color scheme or hover effects:

Colors: Look for custom CSS variables or classes like .text-ajmf-primary, .bg-ajmf-secondary, etc., in your global stylesheet.

Images: To change the gallery images, update the background-image: url(...) paths within the .image-placeholder-* classes in src/App.css. Ensure new images are placed in the /public/images folder.

3D Hover: The 3D effect on the Feature Cards is managed by the FeatureCard component in conjunction with the custom [perspective:1000px] and group-hover:rotate-x-3 classes in src/App.css.
